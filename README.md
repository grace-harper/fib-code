Hello! 

This repo, fib-code, is an implemention of the Fibonacci Decoder described in Georgia Nixon and Ben Brown's  [paper](`https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11738`)  

*Please note this repository is still in its experimental form. There will be breaking changes.*


# installation 
`pip install -e .`

# to run tests 
`python -m unittest tests/` # should not currently pass  

# codeword + errors + decoding example: 
Look in `using_fibcode/demo.ipnyb` for an example of how to setup logging, generate a code, add errors, and run the decoder.
